## Description

-Greetings!

The **Weather Dashboard** is a browser-based application which allows users to search, and view, the current and multi-day weather conditions of any city they choose. The application stores the user's searches for quick and easy re-utilization at a later date. It features dynamically updating HTML and CSS that responds to user input queries by providing accurate weather information harnessed from OpenWeather APIs.


## Installation

Since the **Weather Dashboard** is a completely browser-based application, no installation requirements are necessary. Users may clone the application source code directly onto their local computer from the GitHub repository.

## Usage

To generate the weather details for a chosen city, follow these steps:

1. Type in the name of any city of choice in the the search bar (beneath the prompt title "Search for a City").

2. Click the search button.

3. The chosen city's current weather and climate (along with the future five-day forecast) will dynamically be rendered onto the browser webpage.


## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the application is as follows:
